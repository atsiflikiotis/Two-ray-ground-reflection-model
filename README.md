# Two-ray-ground-reflection-model

Python code for two-ray ground-reflection model simulation and comparison with Free Space Loss model and a simplified two-ray model, assuming that two rays are always combined coherently, with a reflection factor |Γ|, so the sum of rays is produced by multiplying the LOS ray with u=1+|Γ|.
(FSPL is when u=1 (only 1 ray)).
